## 10/6/2023
### There are a total of four Python files used for Project 2. The description of each of them is as follows:
* `kruskal.py` - This file contains the implementation of the Kruskal's algorithm for minimum spanning tree.
* `kruskal_theory.py` - This file contains the code to generate theoretical values for Kruskal's algorithm.
* `kruskal_normalized.py` - This file contains code to normalize the data values obtained from Kruskal's algorithm.
* `kruskal_3d.py` - This file contains the code to generate the time complexity plot for varying input parameters.
